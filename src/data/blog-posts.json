      "excerpt": "Most SPM vendors just bolted \"AI-powered\" onto the same stale legacy platform they've been selling for a decade. That's not Intelligent SPM. That's a rebrand.",
      "content": "Here's the deal.\n\nMost SPM vendors just bolted \"AI-powered\" onto the same stale legacy platform they've been selling for a decade. New label on the same architecture. Same blind spots. Same limitations dressed up in a press release.\n\nThat's not Intelligent SPM. That's a rebrand.\n\nSo let's get the ledger straight—what AI actually changes about Sales Performance Management, where the alignment is real, and where you should be suspicious of anyone promising magic.\n\n**The problem isn't calculations. It's everything around them.**\n\nYour SPM system can multiply. It can also add, subtract, and divide. So can a $12 calculator from Walgreens—and the calculator doesn't need a three-month implementation.\n\nThe hard part of commissions was never the arithmetic. It's the interpretation. It's what happens when a rep reads the plan document and walks away with a different number than finance. It's what happens when you deploy a new accelerator and three territories blow past cap because nobody simulated the downstream effect. It's what happens when a dispute lands on your desk and you have no receipts—just a spreadsheet someone emailed in March.\n\nThat gap, between \"we computed a number\" and \"we can prove why that number is right\"—that's where AI earns its keep.\n\n**The 8 Levers. Then the AI question.**\n\nIf you've seen our **8 Levers of Intelligent SPM**, you know the full picture: Strategy, Compliance, Planning, Technology, Operations, Analytics, Governance, Enablement. Pull a lever wrong, and you get behavior drift, legal exposure, unfair quotas, late pay—or all of the above.\n\nThose levers cover the *what* of Intelligent SPM. The complete operating system.\n\nBut when your vendor tells you they \"added AI,\" the real question is: *which levers does AI actually pull?* And *how?* That's where the five AI layers come in. Think of them as the intelligence infrastructure that makes the levers work—not a replacement for the framework, but the engine underneath it.\n\n**Five layers. That's the AI architecture.**\n\nEach layer maps to the levers it powers. Each one solves a specific failure mode that legacy SPM, AI-labeled or not, ignores.\n\n**Layer 1: Plan Interpretation.** Your comp plan is a document. It's written in English (barely). AI turns those rules into executable logic—versioned, testable, auditable. When the plan says \"attainment above 120% triggers a 2x accelerator,\" that's not a sentence anymore. It's a contract. Enforceable. Traceable.\n\n*Powers: Incentive Architecture, Compliance Guardrails*\n\nDisputes drop when the rules aren't open to interpretation. You stop arguing about what the plan *means* and start arguing about whether it's *working*. That's a better argument to have.\n\n**Layer 2: Simulation.** Before you deploy a plan change, you should know what it's going to do. Not \"feel pretty good about it.\" Know. AI-powered simulation lets you run what-if scenarios against real historical data—before the change goes live and before the CFO calls you.\n\n*Powers: Capacity & Coverage, Incentive Architecture*\n\nThe old way: change the plan, wait a quarter, find out you overpaid by $2.3M. The Intelligent SPM way: simulate it Tuesday, find the exposure Wednesday, fix it Thursday.\n\n**Layer 3: Telemetry.** This is the layer most people skip, and it's the one that saves your job. Telemetry means continuous monitoring—behavior drift, anomaly detection, leading indicators that something is going sideways before it shows up in a quarterly review.\n\n*Powers: Signal & Forecast, Payout Engine*\n\nYou don't wait for a building to collapse to check the foundation. Telemetry is your structural inspection, running all the time.\n\n**Layer 4: Exceptions Infrastructure.** Disputes happen. Overrides happen. The question is whether you have provenance or you have a mess. Intelligent SPM gives every exception a chain of custody—who requested it, who approved it, what rule it overrode, and what the financial impact was.\n\n*Powers: Payout Engine, Compliance Guardrails*\n\nReceipts. Every time. No more \"I think someone approved that in an email somewhere last quarter.\"\n\n**Layer 5: Governance.** The layer that holds the other four accountable. Audit trails. Policy gates. Approval workflows that actually enforce separation of duties instead of hoping someone checks the box.\n\n*Powers: Controls & Evidence, Enablement Loop*\n\nThis is where you build the courtroom: evidence in, decisions out.\n\n**Where AI fits—and where it doesn't**\n\nAI is not doing all five of these by itself. Let's be precise.\n\n**AI is excellent at:** pattern recognition across large comp datasets, natural language interpretation of plan documents, anomaly detection in payout behavior, generating simulation scenarios from historical performance, and surfacing exceptions that would take a human analyst weeks to find.\n\n**AI is not a replacement for:** business judgment on plan design, relationship management when a rep is angry about their check, regulatory compliance decisions, or the political negotiation of getting finance and sales to agree on anything.\n\nThe alignment is simple. AI handles the pattern work, the monitoring, and the evidence chain. Humans handle the decisions, the relationships, and the accountability. If someone tells you AI will \"automate your comp plan,\" ask them one question: automate *which part*? If they can't answer with specifics—they're selling vibes.\n\n**What this means for your Monday morning**\n\nYou don't need to rip out your SPM platform. You need to ask it harder questions.\n\n**Start here:** Pick one of the five layers—the one where you're bleeding the most. For most teams that's Layer 4 (Exceptions) or Layer 3 (Telemetry). You're either drowning in disputes with no audit trail, or you're finding problems 90 days too late.\n\nThen ask: does our current system support this layer, or are we duct-taping it with spreadsheets and email threads?\n\nThat answer tells you where Intelligent SPM enters the picture. Not as a replacement. As the intelligence layer your current system is missing.",

      "excerpt": "Do you have a complete governance package? Not a comp plan — a governance package. Most companies have zero written policies. Here are the 17 that matter.",
      "content": "Here's a question that separates the professionals from the amateurs: do you have a complete governance package for your sales compensation program?\n\nNot a comp plan. A governance package.\n\nThe plan tells reps how they get paid. The governance package tells your organization how the plan is managed, changed, enforced, and protected.\n\n**Most companies have zero written policies.**\n\nI'm not exaggerating. I've walked into organizations running $50M+ incentive programs with no written policy on clawbacks, no exception approval framework, no change management protocol, and no dispute resolution process. Everything is handled \"by feel.\" Which works great until it doesn't—and when it doesn't, it's usually expensive, public, and legally discoverable.\n\n**The 17 SCP Policies**\n\nWe've codified 17 Sales Compensation Policies that cover the full governance surface area. Every one of them is a policy you either have and enforce, or don't have and are exposed.\n\n**Plan Governance:**\n- SCP-001: Plan Document Standards — What must every plan include?\n- SCP-002: Plan Approval Authority — Who can approve plan changes?\n- SCP-003: Mid-Year Plan Changes — When and how can plans change?\n- SCP-004: Plan Communication Requirements — How are plans communicated?\n\n**Financial Controls:**\n- SCP-005: Clawback & Forfeiture — When can you take money back?\n- SCP-006: Windfall Prevention — How do you handle outsized payouts?\n- SCP-007: 409A & Deferred Comp — Are your plans compliant?\n- SCP-008: True-Up & Reconciliation — How do you handle corrections?\n\n**Operational Framework:**\n- SCP-009: Exception Management — How are exceptions categorized, approved, and tracked?\n- SCP-010: Dispute Resolution — What's the process when reps challenge their pay?\n- SCP-011: Split & Overlay Crediting — Who gets credit when multiple reps are involved?\n- SCP-012: Territory Change Protocol — What happens to quotas and pipeline when territories shift?\n\n**Data & Compliance:**\n- SCP-013: Data Source Authority — Which systems are the source of truth?\n- SCP-014: Calculation Audit Trail — Can you trace any payout back to its source?\n- SCP-015: Separation of Duties — Who can change what, and who checks them?\n- SCP-016: Regulatory Compliance — How do you stay current with pay equity, tax, and labor laws?\n- SCP-017: Termination & Leave — What happens to comp when reps leave or go on leave?\n\n**The Self-Assessment**\n\nGo through that list. For each policy, ask yourself three questions:\n\n1. **Do we have a written policy?** Not a verbal understanding—a written, approved document.\n2. **Is it enforced consistently?** Not just when convenient—every time.\n3. **Can we prove it?** Not just claim it—produce the evidence.\n\nIf you answered \"no\" to any of those for any policy, you have a governance gap. And governance gaps have a way of becoming governance crises at the worst possible time.\n\n**Do You Have a Complete Governance Package?**\n\nMost organizations cover 4-5 of these 17. Some cover 8-10. Almost nobody covers all 17. The ones who do are the ones who sleep soundly during audit season.\n\nWe've published all 17 policies with detailed descriptions, implementation guidance, and real-world examples. It's the most complete SPM governance reference available—and it's free.\n\nThe question isn't whether you need these policies. The question is which ones are going to bite you first.\n\n**Read the full 17 SCP Policies at intelligentspm.com/learn/policies** — each one with detailed descriptions, categories, and implementation guidance.\n\n**Not sure which policies you're missing?** Take The Checkup—our SPM health assessment identifies your governance gaps in about 10 minutes.",

      "content": "Every comp plan sits on top of an operating system most people can't see. I call it the 8 Levers of Intelligent SPM—and if you're only pulling one or two, you're flying blind.\n\n**The Framework**\n\n- **Incentive Architecture** — Plan design, rate structures, accelerators, caps. This is what most people think SPM *is*. It's one lever out of eight.\n- **Compliance Guardrails** — Regulatory requirements, equal pay, 409A, clawback rules. The legal backbone nobody builds until they need it.\n- **Capacity & Coverage** — Territory design, quota allocation, headcount planning. The math that determines whether reps *can* hit their number.\n- **Signal & Forecast** — Leading indicators, pipeline analytics, attainment predictions. The crystal ball that's only useful if someone acts on it.\n- **Payout Engine** — Calculation accuracy, dispute resolution, payment timing. The part that touches every rep's wallet—get it wrong and trust evaporates.\n- **Controls & Evidence** — Audit trails, approval workflows, separation of duties. The courtroom-ready infrastructure.\n- **Enablement Loop** — Training, communication, change management. The most neglected lever—and the one that determines whether anyone actually understands the plan.\n- **Strategy Alignment** — Connecting plan design to business objectives. The lever that asks \"why are we paying this way?\"\n\n**Why Most Companies Pull 2-3 and Ignore the Rest**\n\nFinance focuses on Payout Engine and Compliance. Sales Ops focuses on Capacity and Signal. HR touches Enablement. The CIO handles the Technology layer.\n\nBut nobody owns all eight.\n\nThat's the gap. Each lever is someone's priority and everyone else's afterthought. The result: plans that calculate correctly but don't drive the right behavior. Governance that exists in theory but not in practice. Analytics that generate reports nobody reads.\n\n**The Interaction Effect**\n\nLevers don't operate independently. Change one, and you affect the others:\n\n- Redesign incentive architecture without updating enablement — Reps don't understand the new plan. Disputes spike.\n- Improve the payout engine without tightening controls — Faster calculations, same governance gaps.\n- Add forecasting analytics without strategy alignment — Great predictions about outcomes nobody planned for.\n\nThis is why point solutions fail. You can't fix SPM one lever at a time.\n\n**929 Cards. Every Scenario Mapped.**\n\nWe've built a knowledge base with 929 cards covering every scenario across all 8 levers. Territory changes. Exception handling. Rate table design. Clawback triggers. Split crediting rules. Quota methodology.\n\nEach card is a practical answer to a specific SPM question.

      "excerpt": "Most companies 'do SPM' the way most people 'do taxes' — they know they have to, they don't fully understand it, and they pray the audit never comes.",
      "content": "Most companies \"do SPM\" the way most people \"do taxes\"—they know they have to, they don't fully understand it, and they pray the audit never comes.\n\nLet me fix that.\n\n**SPM is not software. SPM is a discipline.**\n\nSales Performance Management is the practice of aligning what your sellers do with what your business needs. That covers territory planning, quota setting, incentive design, execution, governance, and analytics. If you're only thinking about the commission calculation, you're looking at maybe 10% of the picture.\n\nThe vendors love to conflate SPM with ICM (Incentive Compensation Management). It's convenient—they sell calculators and call them \"SPM platforms.\" But calculating commissions is to SPM what addition is to accounting. Necessary, but nowhere near sufficient.\n\n**The 8 Levers—the operating system**\n\nEverything in SPM maps to one of 8 levers: Strategy, Compliance, Planning, Technology, Operations, Analytics, Governance, and Enablement. Pull one wrong, and the whole machine drifts. Pull several wrong, and you get what I see every day—comp plans that technically work but strategically fail.\n\nMost organizations are strong on 2-3 levers and blind to the rest. Technology teams nail the calculation engine but ignore governance. Finance teams nail compliance but ignore enablement. Sales ops nails operations but can't connect it to strategy.\n\n**The Five Things That Actually Break**\n\nAfter twenty years in this space, here's what I see break most often:\n\n1. **Plans that don't match reality.** You designed for a world that doesn't exist. Reps encounter scenarios every week that the plan doesn't cover, and each one becomes a dispute or an exception.\n\n2. **Incentives that reward the wrong behavior.** You wanted reps to sell new logos. Your plan rewards revenue. Reps renew whales. Mission failed.\n\n3. **Calculations nobody trusts.** If your reps can't independently verify their own paycheck, you've failed the transparency test. \"Trust me\" is not a methodology.\n\n4. **Governance that doesn't exist.** Exceptions managed in email. Approvals over Slack. Disputes resolved by whoever yells loudest. One audit away from chaos.\n\n5. **Analytics nobody acts on.** You have dashboards. Nobody looks at them. You have data. Nobody uses it. The insights exist—the operational loop doesn't.\n\n**Where to Start (If You're Starting From Zero)**\n\nDon't rip and replace everything. Pick the lever that's bleeding the most. For most teams, that's Governance or Operations.\n\nAsk three questions:\n- Can we explain any rep's paycheck in under 5 minutes?\n- Do we have a documented process for exceptions?\n- Can we simulate the impact of a plan change before deploying it?\n\nIf the answer to any of those is \"no\"—you know where to start.\n\n**Go Deeper**\n\nThis is the 10-minute version. The full SPM 101—including the complete 8 Levers framework, common mistakes by industry, and where-to-start guides—lives on our site. It's free, it's ungated, and it's written in English instead of vendor-speak.\n\n**Read the full SPM 101 at intelligentspm.com/learn/spm-101** — the fundamentals of SPM without the vendor spin.",

      "content": "\"Attainment.\" \"Crediting.\" \"Draw.\" \"True-up.\"\n\nYour sales team, your finance team, and your ops team all use these words. They don't all mean the same thing by them.\n\nAnd that disconnect? It's behind more disputes, more misaligned plans, and more expensive mistakes than any technical failure I've ever seen.\n\n**The Language Problem**\n\nSPM has a language problem. Every function—sales, finance, operations, legal—brings its own vocabulary. Same words, different meanings:\n\n- **\"Closed deal\"** — Sales says signed contract. Finance says recognized revenue. Legal says executed and counter-signed with all conditions met. Three teams, one phrase, three interpretations, one commission dispute.\n\n- **\"Credit\"** — Does it mean the rep is assigned to the account? Gets commission? Gets quota relief? All three? Different answer depending on who you ask.\n\n- **\"Override\"** — Is it a manager's commission on their team's sales? Or an exception to a standard rule? Your comp admin hears one thing, your VP hears another, and somebody's check is wrong.\n\n**Why This Matters More Than You Think**\n\nAmbiguous language is the #1 root cause of compensation disputes. Not bad math. Not system errors. Words.\n\nWhen your plan says \"reps earn commission on closed deals\" and doesn't define \"closed,\" \"commission,\" or \"deal\" with precision—every rep reads it through their own lens. The generous interpretation becomes the expectation, and the gap between expectation and reality becomes a dispute.\n\nI've seen a single undefined term—\"booking date\"—cost a company $1.4M in overpayments. They had three different definitions across three systems, and nobody noticed for six months.\n\n**The Fix: A Shared Vocabulary**\n\nBefore you can govern comp, you need everyone speaking the same language. Every term that touches money needs:\n\n1. **A single definition** — Not the sales definition or the finance definition. THE definition.\n2. **System mapping** — Where does this value live in your CRM, ERP, and ICM?\n3. **Edge case coverage** — What happens at the boundaries? Partial deals? Multi-year contracts? Channel splits?\n\n**The Test**\n\nPull up three terms your team uses regularly. Ask your sales lead, your finance lead, and your ops lead to define each one independently.\n\nIf you get three matching answers, congratulations—you're in better shape than 90% of organizations I've worked with.\n\nIf you don't? Now you know where the problems start.\n\n**50+ Terms Defined**\n\nWe've published a comprehensive SPM glossary covering 50+ terms organized by the 8 Levers of Intelligent SPM. Each term is defined in plain language—no jargon, no circular definitions, no vendor-speak.\n\nThis isn't an academic exercise. It's a working reference. Pin it to your team's shared space. Use it in plan design sessions. Reference it in your plan documents.

      "content": "**Sin #1: Ambiguous Definitions**\n\n\"Closed deal\" means different things to different people. To sales, it's when the contract is signed. To finance, it's when cash hits the account. To legal, it's when all conditions are met. Your plan says \"closed deal\" without defining which one—and now you have three interpretations fighting for the same commission dollar.\n\nThe fix: Define every term that touches money. Booking date. Revenue recognition date. Commission eligibility date. If it's not written down, it doesn't exist.\n\n**Sin #2: Undefined Crediting Rules**\n\nWho gets credit when two reps touch the same deal? The plan says \"sales credit goes to the responsible rep.\" But what does \"responsible\" mean? First touch? Last touch? Biggest influence? Most senior?\n\nI've seen deals with 47 people claiming credit. That's not a comp plan—that's a lottery.\n\n**Sin #3: Missing Edge Cases**\n\nYour plan covers the happy path beautifully. Rep closes deal, rep gets paid. But what about:\n- Deals that close after a rep leaves?\n- Customers who cancel within 30 days?\n- Renewals where the original rep is now a manager?\n- Split territories mid-quarter?\n\nEvery edge case you don't define becomes a dispute.\n\n**Sin #4: Accelerators Without Guardrails**\n\nUncapped accelerators sound great until a rep closes a whale deal and makes more than the CEO. Suddenly \"unlimited earning potential\" becomes \"board-level crisis.\"\n\nAlways model your accelerators against realistic (and unrealistic) scenarios before you publish them.\n\n**Sin #5: Retroactive Changes**\n\n\"We're adjusting quotas effective three months ago.\" This sentence has launched more lawsuits than any other in compensation history.\n\nChanges should be prospective. Period. If you need to adjust, do it going forward with clear communication and rationale.\n\n**Sin #6: Invisible Calculations**\n\nIf a rep can't independently verify their own paycheck, you've failed. \"Trust us\" isn't a calculation methodology—it's a recipe for distrust.\n\nEvery element that affects payout should be visible, traceable, and explainable.\n\n**Sin #7: No Exception Framework**\n\nYou will have exceptions. The question is whether they're governed or chaotic.\n\nCreate categories. Define approval paths. Document rationale. Track precedent. Otherwise, your exception queue becomes your actual comp plan.",

It executes the decisions you've already made.\n\n**What ICM Does**\n\nICM tools are brilliant at:\n- Calculating commissions based on rules you define\n- Processing transactions at scale\n- Generating statements and reports\n- Tracking attainment against quota\n- Managing plan documents\n\nThis is execution. This is the \"how.\"\n\n**What ICM Doesn't Do**\n\nICM tools don't:\n- Tell you if your plan makes strategic sense\n- Catch logical contradictions in your rules\n- Identify gaming vectors before reps find them\n- Decide who should get an exception\n- Explain why a payout is fair\n- Prevent disputes before they happen\n\nThis is governance. This is the \"should we.\"\n\n**The Gap**\n\nThe gap between execution and governance is where every comp disaster lives:\n- The plan that's technically correct but strategically insane\n- The exception that \"seemed reasonable\" but created precedent chaos\n- The rule change that nobody communicated properly\n- The edge case that nobody anticipated\n\nYour ICM tool will faithfully execute all of these. It won't tell you they're wrong.\n\n**Building Real Governance**\n\nGovernance requires:\n1. **Policy layer** — What are the principles behind the plan?\n2. **Control layer** — What are the limits and guardrails?\n3. **Exception layer** — How do we handle the unexpected?\n4. **Audit layer** — Can we prove what happened and why?\n\nNone of these live in your ICM tool by default.

The problem is they compound.\n\n**The Compounding Effect**\n\nException #1 creates precedent.\nException #2 references Exception #1.\nException #47 references Exceptions #12, #23, and #31—none of which were documented properly.\n\nNow you have:\n- No standard process\n- Inconsistent treatment across reps\n- No way to forecast cost\n- Legal exposure everywhere\n- A comp team drowning in one-offs\n\n**The Root Cause**\n\nExceptions explode when the plan doesn't fit reality. They're a symptom, not the disease.\n\nAsk yourself:\n- Why do we need so many exceptions?\n- What scenarios does the plan not cover?\n- Where are the gaps between policy and execution?\n\nUsually, the plan was designed for an ideal world that doesn't exist.\n\n**Taking Back Control**\n\n**Step 1: Categorize**\nNot all exceptions are equal. Create categories:\n- Deal structure exceptions\n- Territory/crediting exceptions\n- Timing exceptions\n- Quota exceptions\n- Payout exceptions\n\n**Step 2: Define Approval Paths**\nWho can approve what? A $5K exception shouldn't need the CFO. A $500K exception shouldn't be approved by a sales manager.\n\n**Step 3: Document Everything**\nEvery exception needs:\n- Business rationale\n- Financial impact\n- Approval chain\n- Expiration date\n- Precedent implications\n\n**Step 4: Track Precedent**\nWhen someone requests an exception, you should be able to see: \"We've handled similar situations X times, and here's what we did.\"\n\n**Step 5: Feed It Back**\nIf you're approving the same exception type repeatedly, it shouldn't be an exception—it should be a plan rule.\n\n**The Goal**\n\nYou'll never have zero exceptions. The goal is governed exceptions—predictable, documented, and defensible.",

Which clause?\n- What's the effective date?\n- Who approved this version?\n\nIf the plan says \"reps earn 10% on closed revenue,\" you should be able to trace any payment back to that sentence.\n\n**Layer 2: Data Evidence**\nWhere did the numbers come from?\n- Source system (CRM, ERP, billing)\n- Extract date and time\n- Any transformations applied\n- Data quality validations\n\nIf someone disputes the deal value, you should be able to show exactly where that number originated.\n\n**Layer 3: Calculation Evidence**\nHow did you get from inputs to outputs?\n- Rule logic applied\n- Rate tables used\n- Accelerator thresholds\n- Split allocations\n\nIf a rep asks \"why is my commission $4,237.50 instead of $5,000?\"—you should be able to walk through every step.\n\n**Layer 4: Approval Evidence**\nWho authorized what?\n- Plan approvals\n- Exception approvals\n- Override approvals\n- Payout approvals\n\nIf an auditor asks \"who approved this exception?\"—you should have the answer in seconds, not days.\n\n**Building the Evidence Chain**\n\nStart with the payout and work backward:\n1. This payout of $X was calculated by rule Y\n2. Rule Y used data from source Z\n3. The data showed deal value of $A, attainment of B%\n4. Plan section 3.2.1 authorizes this calculation\n5. The plan was approved by [name] on [date]\n\nEvery link in the chain should be documented and retrievable.\n\n**The Audit Test**\n\nCan you answer these questions in under 5 minutes?\n- Why did Rep X receive $Y on their last statement?\n- What would happen if we changed the rate table?\n- How many exceptions were approved last quarter?\n- Which plan version was in effect on [date]?\n\nIf any answer takes longer than 5 minutes, your evidence trail has gaps.\n\n**The Payoff**\n\nEvidence-based SPM isn't just about compliance (though it helps). It's about:\n- Faster dispute resolution\n- Higher rep trust\n- Better forecasting\n- Defensible decisions\n- Operational confidence\n\nWhen everything is traceable, everything is fixable.",

Period. Retroactive changes are legal landmines and operational nightmares.\n\n**Principle 2: Defined Trigger Events**\nWhat justifies a quota change?\n- Territory realignment (gain or loss of accounts)\n- Product changes (new SKUs, discontinued products)\n- Market events (major customer bankruptcy, competitor exit)\n- Role changes (promotion, territory expansion)\n\nIf it's not on the list, it's not a reason for adjustment.\n\n**Principle 3: Standard Calculation Methods**\nHow do you calculate the adjustment?\n- Pro-rata for time-based changes\n- Pipeline transfer rules for territory changes\n- Documented formulas for capacity changes\n\nNo \"gut feel\" adjustments.

You need rules for:\n- Pipeline credit (who gets credit for deals in flight?)\n- Historical credit (who gets credit for deals that closed before the change?)\n- Quota transfer (how much quota moves with the accounts?)\n- Transition period (is there overlap or hard cutover?)\n\nDocument these rules BEFORE you need them.",

They're paid to optimize outcomes—and they will optimize your comp plan whether you intended them to or not.\n\nThis isn't malicious. It's rational.

Design plans that align incentives with intent\n2. Model edge cases before launch\n3. Monitor for pattern emergence\n4. Adjust quickly when gaming appears\n5. Communicate that you're watching\n\nThe goal isn't perfect prevention. It's making exploitation harder than legitimate selling.",

Plan Analysis**\nAI can read plan documents and identify:\n- Ambiguous language\n- Missing definitions\n- Logical contradictions\n- Gap in coverage\n\nThis is pattern recognition at scale—something AI does well.\n\n**2. Gaming Detection**\nAI can monitor transaction patterns and flag:\n- Unusual deal clustering\n- Timing anomalies\n- Split patterns\n- Credit disputes\n\nThis is anomaly detection—another AI strength.\n\n**3. Scenario Modeling**\nAI can simulate plan changes against historical data:\n- Cost projections under different assumptions\n- Payout distributions\n- Attainment predictions\n\nThis is computational simulation—AI handles complexity well.\n\n**4. Document Generation**\nAI can draft:\n- Plan summaries\n- Rep statements\n- Exception documentation\n- Audit reports\n\nThis is language generation—AI's core capability.\n\n**Where AI Doesn't Help (Yet)**\n\n**1. Strategic Decisions**\n\"Should we cap accelerators?\"\n\nThis requires business judgment that AI can't provide. AI can model the impact of capping vs. not capping—but the decision is human.\n\n**2. Exception Approval**\n\"Should we approve this exception?\"\n\nAI can flag precedent and calculate impact, but the judgment call requires human context and accountability.\n\n**3. Conflict Resolution**\n\"How do we handle this dispute?\"\n\nDisputes involve relationships, politics, and judgment that AI can't navigate.\n\n**4. Change Communication**\n\"How do we tell the sales team about this change?\"\n\nAI can draft language, but communication strategy requires human understanding of culture and context.\n\n**The Integration Model**\n\nThe best AI applications in SPM follow a pattern:\n1. AI does the analysis (fast, comprehensive)\n2. Humans make the decisions (judgment, accountability)\n3. AI implements at scale (consistent, traceable)\n4. Humans handle exceptions (relationship, context)\n\nThis isn't AI replacing humans. It's AI augmenting humans—doing the computational heavy lifting so humans can focus on judgment.\n\n**The Build vs. Buy Question**\n\nShould you build AI capabilities or buy them?\n\n**Build if:**\n- Your comp structure is highly unique\n- You have strong data science resources\n- Integration with existing systems is critical\n- You want full control over the logic\n\n**Buy if:**\n- Your needs are relatively standard\n- You want faster time-to-value\n- You prefer proven algorithms\n- You don't have AI expertise in-house\n\nMost organizations should buy for commoditized AI (gaming detection, scenario modeling) and build for strategic AI (custom analysis, proprietary rules).",
